## Literature Review

### Abstract

Using a big data set of venture capital financing and related startup firms from Crunchbase, this paper develops a machine- learning model called CapitalVX (for “Capital Venture eXchange”) to predict the outcomes for startups, i.e., whether they will exit successfully through an IPO or acquisition, fail, or remain private. Using a large feature set, the out-of-sample accuracy of predictions on startup outcomes and follow-on funding is 80e89%. This research suggests that VC/PE firms may be able to benefit from using machine learning to screen potential investments using publicly available information, diverting this time instead into mentoring and monitoring the investments they make. ??????

### Introduction

#### CapitalVX: A machine learning model for startup selection and exit prediction

Using publicly available data sets, obtained from **\_\_\_\_** we are willing to refine the usage of machine learning in the domain of Venture Capital Investment by training machine learning models using data that is obtained, in order to come up with more reliable real-time predictions of the future state of any startup given we have access to the required parameters so that the machine learning algorithm can operate successfully.

_We implemented a combination of Deep Learning, XGBoost, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors for the purposes of this study._

_The general process in the pipeline is to first perform exploratory data analysis, extract the features, retrain the models, and then evaluate our predictions based on known events._
